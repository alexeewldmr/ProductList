Hello, Scandiweb Developer team.

This my Junior Product list project.
First of all i just want to say thank you, that you have gaven me the opportunity to improve my task.
At this moment I improved UI design, in the product list project, now looks different.

I am also added sidebar with list Category, logging where you can logged on admin account.
Login `admin` password `admin1`, and you will be redirected to DeleteProduct page, where you can delete Product by `id`
number. Also you can create your own account, `Register New User` There will be form for register new user `Login` and
`Password`. Also in sidebar has last one small form for subscribe feedback, write email, this email saves in DB `Subscribe`
table.

I also attached different footer menu, with categories, info section, support form completed this information saves in
`ContactUs` table, and Google map with fiction Product list office in Riga.

All products has single pages, I used the GET method. In single pages you can read short description about product.

Also I used POST method for adding new product, this forms you can find clicking on `AddProduct`, field this form,
product will be automatically be created in additional table and shows up in category in the Project additional page.

This all improvement's I made a this moment. But my goal to improve this project with PHP OOP, at this moment there no OOP.
I'm studding hard to get new knowledge's in PHP, for me it's more thant a hobby, this my passion. Passion to create a good
code, and to be a part of productive team, to share common goals. I see forward that Scandiweb helps me
to achieve my goals, and i will give back all my knowledge and skills to company in future projects.

One more to I'd like thank you, for opportunity make Test Product List Project for your, for me it's very useful experience.

Best regards,
Vladimirs Aleksejevs
